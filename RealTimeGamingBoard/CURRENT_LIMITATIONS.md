# Current Implementation Limitations

This document outlines the differences between the specification requirements and the current demo implementation, highlighting areas where the system deviates from the intended architecture.

## 1. Architecture Deviations

### Game Service Bypass
**Spec Requirement**: Game Service should handle game logic, validate wins, and forward scores to Leaderboard Service
**Current Implementation**: 
- Game Service exists but is mostly unused
- API Gateway directly handles score submissions in-memory
- No game validation logic implemented
- Score updates bypass the Game Service entirely

### Service Responsibilities Mismatch
**Spec Flow**: Client → Game Service → Leaderboard Service → Storage
**Current Flow**: Client → API Gateway → In-memory arrays (no service separation)

## 2. Data Storage Issues

### In-Memory Storage Instead of Persistent
**Spec Requirement**: Leaderboard data should be stored in Redis sorted sets with MySQL backup
**Current Implementation**:
- API Gateway uses Python dictionaries: `games_db = {}`, `scores_db = []`, `leaderboard_db = []`
- Data is lost on service restart
- No persistence mechanism
- Redis is running but empty (no keys stored)

### Redis Underutilization
**Spec Requirement**: Redis sorted sets for O(log n) leaderboard operations
**Current Implementation**:
- Redis server running but completely empty
- No sorted sets being used
- Cache operations all result in misses
- No data being stored in Redis at all

## 3. Real-time Communication Issues

### WebSocket Service Isolation
**Spec Requirement**: Services publish to Redis PUB/SUB → WebSocket Service → Clients
**Current Implementation**:
- API Gateway calls WebSocket service via HTTP POST
- Redis PUB/SUB channels configured but unused
- No services publishing to Redis channels
- WebSocket service subscribes to channels but receives no messages

### Missing Event Flow
**Expected**: Score Service → Redis PUB/SUB → WebSocket Service → Browser
**Actual**: API Gateway → HTTP POST → WebSocket Service → Browser

## 4. Service Integration Problems

### Tournament Service Isolation
**Issue**: Tournament endpoints return mock data instead of calling actual Tournament Service
- API Gateway has tournament endpoint stubs
- Tournament Service running but receiving no requests
- Only showing single trace in Jaeger (health check)
- Tournament Service URL not properly configured until recently fixed

### Leaderboard Service Not Used
**Spec Requirement**: Dedicated Leaderboard Service managing rankings
**Current Implementation**:
- Leaderboard Service exists (Go implementation) but unused
- All leaderboard logic in API Gateway's memory
- No proper ranking algorithms implemented

### Score Service Bypassed
**Spec Requirement**: Score Service should handle score updates
**Current Implementation**:
- Score Service exists but not integrated
- Scores directly updated in API Gateway's arrays
- No score validation or business logic

## 5. Scalability Limitations

### No Sharding Support
**Spec Requirement**: Support for 500M DAU with Redis sharding
**Current Implementation**:
- Single-node in-memory storage
- No partitioning strategy
- Cannot scale beyond single API Gateway instance

### Missing Load Distribution
**Spec Requirement**: Multiple Redis nodes with consistent hashing
**Current Implementation**:
- No Redis cluster configuration
- No load balancing for data storage
- All data in single process memory

## 6. Data Consistency Issues

### No Atomic Operations
**Spec Requirement**: Redis ZINCRBY for atomic score updates
**Current Implementation**:
- Array append operations (not atomic)
- Race conditions possible with concurrent updates
- No transaction support

### Missing Backup Strategy
**Spec Requirement**: MySQL backup for Redis data recovery
**Current Implementation**:
- PostgreSQL configured but underutilized
- No backup mechanism for in-memory data
- No recovery strategy for failures

## 7. Performance Problems

### Inefficient Ranking Calculations
**Spec Requirement**: O(log n) operations using Redis sorted sets
**Current Implementation**:
- O(n log n) sorting on every leaderboard request
- Full array scan for user ranking
- No caching of computed rankings

### Missing Optimizations
**Spec Requirement**: Top 10 cache, user detail cache
**Current Implementation**:
- Recalculates everything on each request
- No caching layer
- Inefficient aggregation logic

## 8. Monitoring and Observability Gaps

### Incomplete Tracing
**Issues Found**:
- User Service traces not propagating initially (fixed)
- Tournament Service showing single trace (fixed)
- Redis operations not traced
- Many services not receiving actual traffic

### Missing Metrics
**Not Implemented**:
- QPS monitoring
- Latency tracking
- Cache hit/miss rates
- Service health metrics beyond basic health checks

## 9. Feature Gaps

### Missing Core Features
- No tie-breaking mechanism (spec mentions timestamp-based)
- No user rank fetching for specific positions
- No "4 players above and below" feature
- No percentile rankings
- No monthly tournament reset

### Authentication/Security
- No proper authentication on score updates
- Client could potentially manipulate scores
- No validation of game wins
- Missing man-in-the-middle attack protection

## 10. Database Schema Issues

### Incomplete Schema Implementation
**Missing Tables**:
- Proper leaderboard tables with indexes
- Score history tracking
- Tournament participant tracking (partially implemented)
- User game history

### No Denormalization
**Spec Requirement**: Denormalized views for fast retrieval
**Current Implementation**: No database views or optimized queries

## Summary

The current implementation is a **simplified demo** that:
- Bypasses proper microservice architecture for easier demonstration
- Uses in-memory storage instead of Redis/databases
- Lacks the distributed, scalable design from the specification
- Misses critical real-time communication patterns
- Doesn't implement proper service separation of concerns

This results in a system that works for demonstration purposes but would fail under production load and doesn't showcase the intended architectural patterns for a scalable gaming leaderboard system.

## Recommendations for Production

1. **Implement proper service flow**: Game Service → Leaderboard Service → Storage
2. **Utilize Redis sorted sets** for all leaderboard operations
3. **Enable Redis PUB/SUB** for real-time updates
4. **Separate concerns** into proper microservices
5. **Add data persistence** and backup strategies
6. **Implement sharding** for scalability
7. **Add proper authentication** and security measures
8. **Complete tracing and monitoring** setup
9. **Optimize database schemas** with proper indexes
10. **Implement missing features** like tie-breaking and relative rankings
