"Look at this README - this isn't just another tutorial project. This is a production-ready distributed key-value database with:

- **Quorum Consistency** - Your data stays consistent even when nodes fail
- **Vector Clocks** - Handles concurrent updates without conflicts  
- **Anti-Entropy** - Automatically syncs data across all nodes
- **Consistent Hashing** - Distributes load evenly across the cluster
- **CRDT Counters** - Perfect for likes, views, and real-time counters

And here's the kicker - it's all built with Python and Flask, but handles enterprise-level features like Kubernetes deployment and Docker containers."
