"Look at this README - it's designed for developers who want to learn. Here's how easy it is:

**Quick Start** - Just clone the repo, run a script, and you have a 3-node cluster running locally.

**Demos** - Run any demo with a single command. Want to see Twitter counters? `python demo_runner.py twitter`. Want to see collaborative editing? `python demo_runner.py collaborative`.

**Documentation** - Every feature has detailed guides. Consistency models, CRDT counters, anti-entropy - it's all documented.

**API Reference** - RESTful APIs for everything. PUT, GET, DELETE - standard HTTP operations.

**Testing** - Comprehensive test suites that you can run locally or in CI/CD.

The best part? You can start with the basics and gradually explore advanced features like vector clocks and CRDTs."
