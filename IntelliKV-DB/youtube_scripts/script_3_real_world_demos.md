# Script 3: Real World Demos and Use Cases (1 Minute)

## ðŸŽ¬ Opening Hook (0-10 seconds)
"Enough theory - let's see this database in action! I'm going to show you real-world demos that prove this isn't just academic code."

## ðŸ“‹ Main Content (10-50 seconds)

### Visual: Show demo section in README
"Look at this README - it's packed with real-world demos:

**Twitter Counter Demo** - Simulates millions of likes and retweets. Watch how the CRDT counters handle concurrent updates without losing a single count.

**Collaborative Editor Demo** - Multiple users editing the same document simultaneously. See how vector clocks prevent conflicts and merge changes perfectly.

**Anti-Entropy Demo** - Watch data automatically sync across nodes, even when some nodes fail and come back online.

**Convergence Demo** - See how all nodes eventually reach the same state, no matter what happens to the network.

These aren't toy examples - they're the same patterns used by Google Docs, Twitter, and Netflix!"
