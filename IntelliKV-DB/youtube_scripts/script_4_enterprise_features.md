**Docker Support** - Containerized with proper health checks and environment configuration.

**Professional Testing** - Comprehensive test suites with temporary directories, cleanup, and metrics tracking.

**Monitoring & Logging** - Built-in health checks, anti-entropy statistics, and detailed logging for debugging.

**Hash Ring Analysis** - APIs to monitor data distribution and migration across nodes.
