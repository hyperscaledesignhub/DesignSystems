# Script 2: Consistency Models Deep Dive (1 Minute)

## ðŸŽ¬ Opening Hook (0-10 seconds)
"Consistency in distributed databases is like trying to keep everyone's phone contacts in sync - it's harder than you think! Let me show you how this database handles it."

## ðŸ“‹ Main Content (10-50 seconds)

### Visual: Show consistency models section in README
"Check out this README section on consistency models. This database gives you two powerful options:

**Quorum Consistency** - Think of it like voting. When you write data, it goes to multiple nodes. When you read, it asks multiple nodes and takes the majority vote. This ensures your data is always consistent, even if some nodes fail.

**Causal Consistency** - This is like tracking who talked to whom. If User A updates a document, and User B reads it, then User B updates it, the system knows B's update happened after A's. No conflicts, no confusion.

And here's the cool part - you can choose which one to use based on your needs. Need speed? Go with quorum. Need perfect ordering? Use causal consistency."
