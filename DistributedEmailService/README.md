## üõ†Ô∏è Development & Customization

### Adding New Services
1. Create service directory under `services/`
2. Implement with FastAPI and tracing
3. Add to `docker-compose.yml`
4. Update API Gateway routing
5. Add health checks and documentation

### Extending the UI
1. Add new components under `ui/src/components/`
2. Update routing in `Dashboard.js`
3. Integrate with backend APIs
4. Add to navigation menu

### Custom Tracing
```python
# In any service
from shared.tracing import tracer, create_span_attributes

@app.post("/endpoint")
async def my_endpoint():
    with tracer.start_as_current_span("operation_name", 
         attributes=create_span_attributes(param="value")):
        # Your business logic
        pass
```

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Services Not Starting**:
```bash
# Check service logs
docker-compose logs [service-name]

# Restart specific service
docker-compose restart [service-name]

# Full cleanup and restart
./scripts/stop-demo.sh
./scripts/start-demo.sh
```

**Memory Issues**:
- Ensure at least 8GB RAM available
- Adjust Elasticsearch memory: `ES_JAVA_OPTS=-Xms256m -Xmx256m`

**Port Conflicts**:
- Check if ports are in use: `netstat -tlnp | grep :8000`
- Modify port mappings in `docker-compose.yml`

**Database Connection Issues**:
- Wait for PostgreSQL health check to pass
- Check database logs: `docker-compose logs postgres`

### Debugging Traces
1. Open Jaeger UI: http://localhost:16686
2. Search by service name or operation
3. View trace timeline and spans
4. Check for errors or performance bottlenecks

### Performance Optimization
- Adjust service replicas in `docker-compose.yml`
- Tune database connection pools
- Configure caching strategies
- Optimize Elasticsearch mappings

## üìä Metrics & Analytics

### Key Performance Indicators
