./run_demo.sh
```

Then open your browser to: **http://localhost:3000/demo_ui.html**

## 🎯 Demo Features Showcase

### 1. **Real-time Location Updates via WebSocket**
- Select a user and click "Login"
- Click "Share Location" to start real-time updates
- Watch the map update in real-time
- Activity feed shows WebSocket messages

### 2. **Find and Display Nearby Friends**
- Login as Alice Johnson (she has 4 nearby friends)
- See the "Nearby Friends" panel populate automatically
- Friends within 5 miles are shown with exact distances
- Click on friends to focus the map on them

### 3. **Location Data Freshness**
- Every location update shows timestamp
- Activity feed displays real-time events
- System metrics show update counts
- Fresh data indicated by "Last seen" timestamps

### 4. **Automatic User Deactivation (10min TTL)**
- Demonstrated through Redis TTL configuration
- Users become inactive after 10 minutes without updates
- System automatically cleans up expired locations

### 5. **Scalable Microservices Architecture**
- **Services Status Panel** shows all 5 microservices
- Each service runs independently in Docker
- API Gateway routes requests to appropriate services
- Real-time health monitoring

### 6. **Load Balancing Support**
- API Gateway serves as single entry point
- Stateless services ready for horizontal scaling
- System metrics show concurrent request handling
- Architecture supports multiple instances

### 7. **Security Features**
- JWT authentication for all protected endpoints
- Rate limiting per IP address (shown in activity)
- Input validation prevents malicious data
- HTTPS-ready configuration

## 🎭 Demo Scenarios

### **Rush Hour Scenario**
- Click "Rush Hour" in demo controls
- Simulates busy city with multiple users moving
- Shows system handling concurrent location updates
- Perfect for demonstrating scalability

### **Friends Meetup Scenario**
- Click "Friends Meetup" in demo controls
- All users converge to a central location
- Shows real-time proximity detection
- Great for demonstrating friend finding logic

### **Moving Demo**

- Simulates traveling along a route
- Shows continuous location tracking

## 🎪 Presentation Tips

### **Opening (30 seconds)**
1. Show the dashboard with all services healthy
2. Point out the 10 demo users already created
3. Highlight the real-time activity feed

### **Core Demo (3-5 minutes)**
1. **Login as Alice Johnson** (most connected user)
   - Shows authentication working
   - Immediately see 4 nearby friends
   
2. **Click "Share Location"**
   - Watch real-time updates in activity feed
   - See WebSocket connection status
   
3. **Run "Rush Hour" scenario**
   - Impressive visual of multiple users moving
   - Activity feed shows rapid updates
   - Metrics dashboard shows increased activity

### **Technical Deep Dive (2-3 minutes)**
1. **Point out Services Status**
   - 5 microservices running independently
   - Real-time health monitoring
   
2. **Show System Metrics**
   - API requests counter
   - Average latency (usually <50ms)
   - WebSocket messages
   - Location updates

3. **Activity Feed**
   - Real-time event stream
   - Shows WebSocket messages
   - Location updates
   - System events

### **Advanced Features (1-2 minutes)**
1. **Map Interaction**
   - Click "Show All" to see all users
   - Click individual friends to focus
   - Real-time marker updates
   
2. **Nearby Friends Logic**
   - Distance calculations in real-time
   - 5-mile radius filtering
   - Friend-only visibility (security)

## 📊 Key Metrics to Highlight

- **10 Demo Users** with realistic friendships
- **Real-time Updates** with <100ms latency
- **5 Microservices** running independently
- **WebSocket Connections** for real-time communication
- **Geographic Accuracy** with precise distance calculations
- **Auto-cleanup** with 10-minute TTL
- **Security** with JWT authentication and rate limiting

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Services Not Starting
```bash
# Check Docker is running
docker ps

# Restart if needed
./shutdown.sh
./startup.sh
```

### Demo UI Not Loading
```bash
# Check if port 3000 is free
lsof -i :3000

# Kill any conflicting processes
pkill -f "python3.*serve_demo.py"

# Restart demo
./run_demo.sh
```

### WebSocket Connection Issues
- Check that port 8904 is accessible
- Verify WebSocket Gateway is healthy
- Try refreshing the browser page
