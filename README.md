# Hyperscale Design Systems

**Real-world system design implementations with practical deployment patterns**

This repository contains complete implementations of distributed systems commonly discussed in system design interviews and used at scale in production. Each system is built with realistic requirements, deployed through multiple environments, and documented with architectural decisions.

## 🏗️ Systems Implemented

### Core Systems (Initial Focus)
| System | Description | Status |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| **Rate Limiter** | Distributed rate limiting with multiple algorithms | 🚧 In Development |
| **Key-Value Database** | Distributed KV store with replication and sharding | 🚧 In Development |
| **YouTube-like Video Platform** | Video upload, processing, and streaming service | 🚧 In Development |
| **Google Maps Clone** | Geospatial data service with routing capabilities | 🚧 In Development |
| **Web Crawler** | Distributed web crawling and indexing system | 🚧 In Development |
| **Chat Application** | Real-time messaging with presence and notifications | 🚧 In Development |
| **Ad Serving System** | Real-time bidding and ad serving platform | 🚧 In Development |

### Planned Extensions
- **Search Engine** - Full-text search with ranking algorithms
- **Payment System** - Transaction processing with fraud detection  
- **CDN** - Content delivery network with edge caching
- **Load Balancer** - Layer 4/7 load balancing with health checks
- **Message Queue** - High-throughput message broker
- **API Gateway** - Request routing, authentication, and rate limiting
- **Notification System** - Multi-channel push notifications
- **Time Series Database** - Metrics storage and analytics
- **URL Shortener** - Link shortening with analytics
- **Social Network** - Activity feeds and graph-based recommendations
- *...and many more classic distributed systems*

This collection grows based on community interest and educational value. Each system represents real-world architectural challenges found in production environments.

## 📚 Learning Levels

Each system is implemented across three progressive levels:

### Level 0: Local Development
- **Focus**: Core algorithms and data structures
- **Environment**: Local development with Docker Compose
- **Includes**: Architecture diagrams, API design, basic implementation
- **Skills**: System design fundamentals, API design, local testing

### Level 1: Kubernetes Deployment
- **Focus**: Container orchestration and service mesh
- **Environment**: Kubernetes (local) → EKS (cloud)
- **Includes**: K8s manifests, service discovery, load balancing
- **Skills**: Container orchestration, microservices, cloud deployment

### Level 2: Production-Grade
- **Focus**: Observability, scaling, and operational concerns
- **Environment**: Full cloud-native with monitoring stack
- **Includes**: Metrics, logging, tracing, auto-scaling, disaster recovery
- **Skills**: Site reliability, monitoring, performance optimization

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/hyperscaledesignhub/DesignSystems.git
cd DesignSystems

# Each system has its own directory
ls -la
# rate-limiter/
# kvdb/
# video-platform/
# maps-service/
# web-crawler/
# chat-app/
# ad-system/
```
