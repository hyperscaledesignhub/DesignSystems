# Skipped Features (Non-Essential for MVP)

## Object Storage Advanced Features
- **Object Versioning**: Multiple versions of same object (complex metadata management)
- **Multipart Upload**: Large file upload in chunks (complex orchestration)
- **Erasure Coding**: Advanced data durability with mathematical encoding

- **Object Lifecycle Policies**: Automatic data archiving/deletion
- **Server-Side Encryption**: Data encryption at rest
- **Object Tagging**: Key-value tags for objects
- **Event Notifications**: Webhook/queue notifications for object events

## Access Control & Security
- **IAM Policies**: Complex JSON-based access policies
- **Bucket Policies**: Resource-based access control
- **Access Control Lists (ACLs)**: Fine-grained permissions
- **Pre-signed URLs**: Time-limited access URLs
- **MFA Delete**: Multi-factor authentication for deletions
- **VPC Endpoints**: Private network access

## Performance & Optimization
- **Content Delivery Network (CDN)**: Global content caching

- **Data Integrity Checks**: Advanced checksum verification

## API Features
- **Range Requests**: Partial object downloads
- **Conditional Requests**: If-Match, If-None-Match headers
- **Metadata-only Operations**: HEAD requests optimization
- **Bulk Delete**: Multiple object deletion in single request

## Monitoring & Observability
- **CloudWatch Integration**: Detailed metrics and logging

## Compliance & Governance
- **Object Lock**: WORM (Write Once Read Many) compliance
- **Legal Hold**: Litigation hold capabilities
- **Retention Policies**: Regulatory compliance features
- **Data Residency**: Geographic data placement controls

## Rationale for Skipping
These features are excluded from the MVP to:
1. **Reduce Complexity**: Focus on core object storage functionality
2. **Faster Development**: Ship working product quickly
3. **Lower Resource Requirements**: Minimize infrastructure needs
4. **Simplified Testing**: Easier to validate core functionality
5. **Clearer Architecture**: Avoid over-engineering for initial version
