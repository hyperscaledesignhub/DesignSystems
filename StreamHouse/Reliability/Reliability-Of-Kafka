How Kafka Forms the cluster? 
Kafka forms cluster in the following way
1.Every broker knows whom to connect with, they hold zookeeper string
2.Every broker after connecting to zookeeper there is an ephemeral node /broker/id/ getting created
3.If broker lost connection this id will be deleted by zookeeper
4. Very first broker connected creates /controller/ node. Which is the leader
5. Leader is responsible for: 1. Assigning leader to partitions in the cluster 2. Replication assignment, like which parition has to be replicated into which node. 3. 
6. In case leader dies /controller node is deleted
7. Again all nodes compete each other and leader gets selected
8. New leader is going to reassigns the ownership of the partitions and decides where replicas live
